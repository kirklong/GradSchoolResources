# GradSchoolResources
Providing all of my graduate school application materials + some unsolicited advice to anyone currently going through the hell that is grad apps. 


# What you will find here
This github hosts a snapshot frozen in time of all of my graduate school application materials, in the hope that they may help others currently struggling through the process. I've included ***everything*** I ever wrote (probably too much material tbh), but you're probably most interested in the documents in the `final drafts` folder as those are the statements I actually submitted. I also included the version of my CV that went out with most of my graduate applications -- if you are interested in the tex code that generates it you can find that in my current CV repository here on github. 

# My stats
Before I offer you unsolicited advice, I suppose you might want to know all of my other stats. I offer these here in the interest of full transparency, but *please do not compare yourself too much* -- you are not just a set of numbers on an application, and I firmly believe the strongest part of your application will lie in your statements and recommendation letters. To be frank, any program that sees you just as a list of stats is probably not a place you want to be anyways. With that disclaimer out of the way, here's all of my numbers:
1. My GPA at the time I applied was about 3.86 (see CV)
2. I took the Physics GRE once and scored in the 12th percentile (I don't remember the raw number and prefer not to think about it).
3. I took the general GRE twice, with my best scores in each category being in the 89th, 94th, and 98th percentiles for quantitative, verbal, and writing. I retook the test because the first time I scored in the 67th on the quantitative portion and after just a little bit of remedial studying I was able to greatly improve that. From what I understand of physics/astronomy graduate programs they mostly care about that number (if they require the GRE). 
4. I applied to 11 graduate programs, with 10 being in astronomy/astrophysics and 1 in computer science. I got rejected from 9 of them:
  a. Stanford (astronomy/astrophysics, rejected)
  b. University of Arizona (astronomy/astrophysics, rejected)
  c. Berkeley (astronomy/astrophysics, rejected)
  d. Caltech (astronomy/astrophysics, rejected)
  e. UC Santa Barbara (astronomy/astrophysics, rejected)
  f. University of Utah (physics/astrophysics, rejected)
  g. UC Santa Cruz (astronomy/astrophysics, rejected)
  h. UCLA (astronomy/astrophysics, rejected)
  i. UC Irvine (physics/astrophysics, rejected)
  j. CU Boulder (astrophysics/planetary science, accepted)
  k. Boise State (computing, accepted)
5. I also applied to the Ford pre-doctoral fellowship and was rejected from that, but those essays are also in the document folders if you are interested in them. Neither of my reviewers left comments, but one rated me almost all in the excellent category and the other rated me almost all in the mediocre category so that's been a real puzzle for me to interpret. It was a good experience practicing writing more formally in "proposal-speak" like this though so I recommend the experience of applying for a fellowship if you have the time/interest if nothing else but for the sake of practicing that academic writing style. 
6. I had zero (0) published papers, no REU's, and only a limited amount of informal research experience with my undergraduate advisor. I tried to post a bunch of my code from that project to another github repo (and link to that repository from my CV) in the hopes that people on the admissions committee might look there and see that I had actually done a lot of work even if nothing had been published/presented, but I highly doubt any of them actually went and looked at it.
